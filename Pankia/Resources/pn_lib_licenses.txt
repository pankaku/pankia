/**
 @mainpage A strict JSON parser and generator for Objective-C

 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange
 format. This framework provides two apis for parsing and generating
 JSON. One standard object-based and a higher level api consisting of
 categories added to existing Objective-C classes.

 Learn more on the http://code.google.com/p/json-framework project site.

 This framework does its best to be as strict as possible, both in what it
 accepts and what it generates. For example, it does not support trailing commas
 in arrays or objects. Nor does it support embedded comments, or
 anything else not in the JSON specification. This is considered a feature.
